# Runbook - Doc Authoring Quickstart

## Purpose

Provide a fast, repeatable guide for choosing the right doc type and linking planning artifacts correctly before implementation.

## Scope

This runbook covers authoring and maintaining roadmap, epic, architecture, feature PRD, and ADR docs in the repo.

## Use This Doc Type Guide

- `docs/product/`: strategy and roadmap.
- `docs/runbooks/`: repeatable team workflows and operational guides.
- `docs/epics/`: strategic initiatives that group multiple features.
- `docs/features/`: implementation-ready feature PRDs with acceptance criteria.
- `docs/architecture/`: cross-cutting system design docs.
- `docs/adrs/`: decision records for non-obvious trade-offs.

## Standard Authoring Order

1. Create or update `docs/product/product-roadmap.md`.
2. Create or update only the current epic doc in `docs/epics/`.
3. Add architecture docs in `docs/architecture/` only when the current epic needs a cross-cutting decision documented.
4. Add feature PRDs in `docs/features/` only for the current epic.
5. Add ADRs in `docs/adrs/` for meaningful trade-off decisions.

## Just-in-Time Planning Rules

- Keep future epics lightweight in the roadmap until they become current.
- Avoid drafting full future epic docs unless they are required to unblock the active epic.
- Avoid drafting future architecture docs and feature PRDs in advance.
- Prefer changing the roadmap over maintaining speculative downstream docs.

## Template Usage

- Start each new runbook from `docs/runbooks/_template.md`.
- Start each new epic from `docs/epics/_template.md`.
- Start each new feature PRD from `docs/features/_template.md`.
- Start each new ADR from `docs/adrs/_template.md`.

## Naming Conventions

- Epic docs use `EPIC-XXXX` IDs and filenames like `docs/epics/EPIC-0001-<slug>.md`.
- Feature PRDs use `FEAT-XXXX` IDs and filenames like `docs/features/FEAT-0001-<slug>.md`.
- Feature implementation branches use `FEAT-XXXX-<slug>`.

## Linking Rules

- Each feature PRD links to exactly one epic.
- Feature PRDs link required architecture docs and ADRs.
- The current epic links all in-scope feature PRDs.
- ADRs reference related epics/features and architecture docs.
- Roadmap reflects current epic status at all times.

## Implementation Gate

Before coding starts:

- Feature PRD status is `In Progress`.
- Feature PRD has acceptance criteria and test plan.
- Required architecture docs and ADRs are linked.
- Branch and draft PR are created from the feature PRD context.

## Status Hygiene

- Update feature status during delivery: `Not Started -> In Progress -> In Review -> Completed`.
- Update epic status as grouped features move forward.
- Update roadmap when epic status changes.

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] New doc uses the correct template.
- [ ] Metadata table is complete and current.
- [ ] Links to related docs are present and valid.
- [ ] Status fields reflect real project state.
- [ ] Feature PRD includes acceptance criteria and test plan.
